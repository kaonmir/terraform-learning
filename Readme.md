# Terraform Learning

## ðŸ–¥ Overview

This is a repository for learning Terraform, a open-source IaaS (infrasturcture as a code)

Why I'm studying this tech is to **define** a AWS resources with written code. I was getting trouble with configuring the AWS resources; EC2, RDS, VPC, ...

Terraform let me release from these freaking duties. Of course I must make me familiar with confiuring. To be a Devops developer, let's get into it.

## ðŸ“š Learning Course

### 1. learn-terraform-aws-instance

This is what I made with followning the official document of Terraform.

### 2. terraform-course-practice

This is what I made with followning the youtube for CrashCourse. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo)

Now I'm available to define not only AWS Instance but also  EIP, Internet Gateway, ...

However, I'm failed with adding a user_data to AWS Instance with separating a user_data file. I should study more to accomplish it
